# Hop's Process Template

Apache Hop Process template is a mature seed that you can use as a base to develop your Apache Hop processes the correct way.

Features implemented and enforced by the template are:

- **Clear directory structure** for code, tests, and configuration files. 
This template gives a Hop project a predefined structure to manage configuration files and process from within a same bundle that can easily be distributed.
- **Single process execution**: if a process instance, same as the one is trying to start, is already executing the new instance will not start. We are used to say that when   
- **Single point for errors' management**: as a good methodological approach the template try to force the management of events and errors in a single point
- **Integration tests enablement**: the template gives you the possibility to easily structure a tests strategy for your code by injecting custom code in your pipelines/workflows structure
- **Event logs structure enable to operational analysis**

We adopt Liquibase in order to keep `config` and `logs` tables up-to-date.

## Prerequisites
#### Liquibase installation 

To be able to create/update the support database conventionally named *integrations_db*, you must install liquibase on your computer. To properly install liquibase on your computer please refer to the installation procedure as specified [here]([here](https://docs.liquibase.com/start/install/home.html))

## Getting started
### Process template setup
TBD

### Support database creation
Remember, in both cases, replace `url`, `username` and `password` with the actual ones.
#### Database creation
In case of brand new database (fresh installation)

```powershell
liquibase update \
    --url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/integrations_db" \
    --changeLogFile="master.xml" \
    --username="postgres" \
    --password="password" 
```

#### Database update
While, if your database already exists (existing environments):

```powershell
liquibase changelogSync \
    --url="jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/integrations_db" \
    --changeLogFile="master.xml" \
    --username="postgres" \
    --password="password"
```

## Process template environment variables
